When entering a blog or comment online, the SyntaxNet parser will check sentences for proper nouns which could be used in linked data. If a proper noun is found it will search amazon/dbpedia/other apis for the resource in question and prompt the user if it really is the item they intend. If they confirm that the search is correct, a semantic link will be made and even include an emoji representation if its confirmed in the user preferences. 

Eg.

User types 

"Would you like to buy the Dell Inspiron?"

Upon closing the sentence, 
1. SyntaxNet picks up Dell Inspiron as a proper noun
2. Searches amazon and dbpedia for Dell Inspiron
3. Finds a resource at amazon.
4. Prompts user if the resource is correct
5. User confirms
